# Jacc    
 Jacc is a lightweight bot that can be used to send a DM to all of your server members. Maybe to alert them of something or advertise something your call

**How to use jacc:**<br/>
Put the bot token in `token = "here"`<br>
Put your UserID in `userid = "here"`<br> 
You use the bot with `prefix`dm "message", default prefix is j! so j!dm "message"<br>

**I am not responsible with anything you do with this bot, it's all your fault.**
